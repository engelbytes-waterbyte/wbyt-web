# How to add a member?🧍‍♀️

Please go into the team.tsx file and copy the following code and paste it directly beneath it, or wherever you want to have your usercard on the page.
Obviously you still have to customize the Element to your liking 🧠.

```
 <TeamItem
        name="ungarmichael"
        description="Hi, I'm Michael. I'm a developer and I love to build things."
        instagram="https://www.instagram.com/ungrmichael"
        github="https://github.com/ungarmichael"
        imageUrl="https://images.obi.at/product/DE/1500x1500/218183_1.jpg"
        role="Leiter"
      />
```

Open a PR afterwards 🚔.
